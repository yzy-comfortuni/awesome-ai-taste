# Visual Explainer

Turn what you know into something a person understands in ten seconds.

```
words  ──►  diagram  ──►  interactive page  ──►  animated explainer
 slow        better        DEFAULT HERE           when asked
```

Climb as high as the request allows. The default output is one HTML page whose spine is figures. Text is caption, not content.

## Deliver

- Write `~/.agent/diagrams/<descriptive-name>.html`, or the path the user gives. One complete file: inline CSS, JS, and SVG favicon. CDN only for fonts and libraries.
- Pi: `visual_explainer` `prepare` → `render` (ask before `prepare` unless a visual was requested). MCP: render tools default to `open:false`. Elsewhere: write the file and open it. Use `viewer:"glimpse"` only on request.
- If a terminal table would have 4+ rows or 3+ columns, render HTML and reply with one summary line.
- Write a Markdown companion (`<name>.md` beside the HTML) only when the user asks for AI-readable output or a source brief. HTML stays the source. Ask before you overwrite one.
- Quick mode: only for a literal `--quick` on `/generate-web-diagram`, `/diff-review`, `/plan-review`, `/project-recap`. Do the same research, read `./quick/README.md` and `./quick/schema.json`, emit the JSON spec, and render with `action:"render_quick"` (Pi) or `node <this skill's directory>/quick/render.mjs spec.json out.html` (resolve the path from the skill directory, not the user's repo). If the content does not fit or rendering fails, use full HTML.

## Show, don't tell

1. **One claim per figure.** Put each figure in `<figure>`; the `<figcaption>` states the claim in one sentence.
2. **Figures lead, words label.** Most sections open with a figure. Reasoning, definitions, trade-offs, and open questions can lead with text, then earn a figure when one helps. Keep the lead to a sentence or two, and prose outside captions light, roughly a short paragraph per screen. Write more when the reader needs the reasoning, not to restate the picture. If a sentence describes the picture, make it a label in the picture.
3. **First viewport = the answer.** The main idea as a picture plus one sentence. To teach a concept, it can be the question and the picture that frames it, with the answer one scroll away. No decorative hero.
4. **Draw the mechanism, not the name.** A request path through a cache beats a box labeled "cache". Label every arrow with a verb: `writes`, `invalidates`, `polls 30s`.
5. **Draw the difference.** To compare options, show the edge or box each one adds or removes.
6. **Encode state in form.** Shape, position, and pattern, plus color. Never color alone.
7. **Every number gets a picture.** Waffle, bars, or sparkline beside it. A number inside a sentence is lost.
8. **Cases become small multiples.** Failure modes, options, environments: the same mini diagram once per case, not a table of sentences.

Shape the page to the content. These are starting points, not templates: merge, reorder, drop, or add sections, and skip any that would be empty.

| Page | Typical shape |
|---|---|
| Concept explainer | question → intuition picture → mechanism (stepper) → edge cases → what to remember |
| Visual plan | target state → current vs. proposed → sequence → risks → done when |
| Review or audit | verdict → evidence figures → risks → next steps |
| Comparison | the difference drawn side by side → trade-offs → recommendation |
| Essay or long read | Paper register: text column with figures beside or between it; more prose is fine |
| One diagram | a single large figure, a headline, and a caption; no sections |

| Content | Figure |
|---|---|
| Architecture, data flow, pipeline, state, before/after | Hand-drawn inline SVG → `references/diagrams.md` |
| Cards, timelines, file maps, side-by-side | CSS grid/flex |
| Scenarios, failure modes, options | Small multiples → `references/diagrams.md` |
| Matrix, audit, many rows of data | `<table>` with status chips |
| Rates, shares, metrics, trends | Waffle, bars, sparklines in SVG; Chart.js only for many interactive series |
| Depth that carries data: embeddings, spatial layouts, geometry | three.js → `references/diagrams.md` |
| Sequence, ER/schema, class, git graph, 12+ nodes with crossings | Mermaid → `references/mermaid.md` |
| A process that changes over time | Stepper or scene player → `references/diagrams.md` |
| A setting the reader should feel: TTL, rollout %, a policy | Live figure → `references/diagrams.md` |
| Slide deck | `references/slides.md` + `templates/slide-deck.html` |

Mermaid is the exception. Use it only when automatic layout saves real work. Hand-drawn SVG gives exact placement, page fonts, theme tokens, and animation. `templates/page.html` is the reference build. Copy its parts (tokens, kit CSS, scripts, components), not its outline, and swap in the register the content needs.

## Words

Write about 80% of the way to ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English):

- Answer first, detail after. Headings state the takeaway ("Cache hits skip Postgres"), not the topic ("Caching").
- One idea per sentence. Mostly short sentences (around 20 words or under). Active voice, present tense.
- Short paragraphs, usually 1–3 sentences. Bold the one key phrase, if any.
- One term per concept, the same every time. Name things by what the reader sees, not by internal structure.
- No idioms, metaphors, filler, or hedges. Specific beats clever. Controls say exactly what they do.
- Use numbered lists for steps. Use plain words over jargon. Spell out an abbreviation the first time.

## Look

Aim for the standard of the best research and engineering pages: exact, calm, visual, and specific to the subject. The reader should feel that someone who understands the system drew every line on purpose, for this topic and no other.

Always read `references/style-guide.md` before HTML. Precedence: the user's words → the project's design system → the style guide.

```
content ──► register ──────────► subject ──► topic motif (2–3 touches)
reviews, metrics   Instrument    Geist · near-black · amber        accent hue from the subject
architecture       Blueprint     IBM Plex · blue-black grid        stage texture · glyphs
concepts, reading  Paper         Newsreader + Atkinson · ink blue  one type habit of the domain
recaps, decks      Editorial     Instrument Serif + Sans           the domain's diagram convention
```

- **Set it like a good magazine.** A 12-column grid with one flush-left axis. Few type sizes with big jumps. Real typographic characters. Charts labeled directly, each with one annotation. The style guide's Typography, Layout, and Figures sections hold the rules.
- **Quiet ground, one signal.** Neutrals carry the page. The accent marks only what the reader must look at now.
- **Craft is part of the meaning.** Raised nodes on a dot-grid stage, shapes that say what a thing is, a halo on the focal element, a glow on the hot path, the number leading the headline. Each effect points at something.
- **The figure is the interface.** Prose terms and figure elements light up together. Overview first, detail on demand.
- **Motion shows change or flow.** Blocks rise in once, numbers count up, dots move along edges at the real rate. No parallax, scroll-jacking, or decorative loops. Under reduced motion, show the final state.
- **Stay on the scale.** No sizes, gaps, radii, or colors outside the style guide.
- **Two schemes:** tokens on `:root`, and `prefers-color-scheme` redefines tokens only.
- **Never:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system-ui as the only font; violet or fuchsia Tailwind accents; neon; glassmorphism; gradient text, backgrounds, or blobs; clip-art, mascots, or emoji markers; centered everything; an accent bar on a rounded card; `01/02/03` when order does not matter.
- **Reading comfort:** `html{font-size:17px}`, `rem` elsewhere. Body ≥ 16px, labels ≥ 12px, SVG labels ≥ 12px as rendered. 45–68ch, left-aligned. Text ≥ 4.5:1, lines ≥ 3:1. Italics and uppercase only for a few words. One focal point per viewport. Show position (`2 / 5`, section nav). Slides keep their `clamp()` px scale.
- **Themes:** switchable themes or fonts, or a named palette (Dracula, Nord…) → `references/themes.md`.

## Known traps

- Set `min-width:0` on grid/flex children, `grid-template-columns:minmax(0,1fr)` on single-column grids, and `overflow-wrap:anywhere` on paths. Put wide tables, code, and SVG in a scroll container.
- Do not put `display:flex` on `<li>` when its markers matter.
- Never give a page class a name Mermaid's SVG also uses: `.node`, `.label`, `.nodeLabel`, `.edgeLabel`, `.cluster`, `.marker`, `.note`, `.actor`, `.commit`. A page rule on any of them restyles every diagram; add a `ve-` prefix instead (`.ve-label`).
- Wrap `history.replaceState` in `try/catch`. It throws on `file://` pages.
- Add section navigation (sticky TOC with scroll-spy) only for 4+ sections.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: copy the template's `.js-motion` pattern, so the final state shows without JS, in print, and under reduced motion.

## Animate

When the user asks for an animated explainer or a video:

- **Default:** an HTML scene player. SVG scenes with play, pause, scrub, and captions, all in one file. See `references/diagrams.md`.
- **Real video (3Blue1Brown style):** first check which tools are installed. Use Manim, Remotion, or Motion Canvas for visuals and ffmpeg to mux. For narration, use ElevenLabs if the user gives a key. If not, use local TTS (macOS `say`, Piper, Kokoro). Do not install tools or spend API credit without asking.
- **Script first.** One claim per scene, a sentence or two of narration, and the picture changes with every sentence.

## Slides and PPTX

Make slides only when asked (`/generate-slides`, `--slides`). Read `references/slides.md`. Export PPTX only on request or with `--pptx`: build the HTML deck first, then run `visual-explainer-pptx deck.html deck.pptx` (or `node ./pptx/export.mjs` from a checkout). Tell the user that HTML stays the source of truth. The PPTX has no animation, navigation, responsive layout, custom fonts, live diagrams, or JS.

## Images

Optional. If `surf` or another image tool is available, you can embed generated images as base64 for a hero or concept art. Never use images for data or structure. The page must work without them.

## Older recipes (optional)

Longer how-to files from v0.11.0, outside this skill. Fetch one only when you need its mechanics: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicobailon/visual-explainer/v0.11.0/plugins/visual-explainer/` + `references/css-patterns.md` (layout and CSS animation recipes) · `references/libraries.md` (Chart.js, anime.js, font pairs) · `references/responsive-nav.md` (sticky TOC with scroll-spy) · `references/slide-patterns.md` (slide layouts, transitions) · `templates/architecture.html` · `templates/data-table.html` · `templates/mermaid-flowchart.html`. They predate this guide: take the mechanics, keep this guide's look and rules.

## Before delivery

```
□ one complete HTML file at the path; opens with no console errors
□ first viewport: main idea as a picture + one sentence
□ figures outnumber prose paragraphs; the lead and prose are short enough that the pictures carry the page
□ every number has a picture; scenarios are small multiples, not a sentence table
□ topic motif: 2–3 touches taken from the subject; page still reads without them
□ each figure: <figure> + "Fig. N" claim figcaption; role="img" + aria-label on the drawing (the SVG, or the Mermaid shell)
□ key terms linked with data-ref where hovering helps
□ no horizontal overflow at 1280px or 390px wide
□ both color schemes work (or one theme was deliberate)
□ type in rem; body ≥16px, labels ≥12px; all text ≥4.5:1 in both schemes; visible keyboard focus
□ headings state takeaways; paragraphs stay short
□ any Mermaid uses the zoom/pan shell
□ every size, gap, and radius is on the style-guide scale; polish pass done
□ typography: real dashes, minus, ×, curly quotes; no-break space before units; tabular figures in data
□ layout: one flush-left axis, consistent section openers, varied rhythm; blurred, each screen still shows one dominant element
□ register fonts and neutrals used exactly; would not pass for a generic dark/violet template
□ slides: each fits, nav chrome works, all source items covered, delivery check passes

# Agents, skills, and commands for seven coding tools

<a id="claude-agents--multi-harness-agentic-plugin-marketplace"></a>

The repository provides 94 plugins (92 local + 2 external), 202 agents, 184 skills, and 105 commands for seven coding tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`), GitHub Copilot, and Pi. Shared source files use the Claude Code format, and adapters provide the formats used by other tools. External entries have their own tool support.

AGENTS.md is the canonical context file. Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity CLI, GitHub Copilot, and Pi read it directly. Claude Code reads it via `CLAUDE.md`, a symlink to this file.

> **Read this file like a table of contents.** Detail lives in `docs/`. Authoring conventions live in `docs/authoring.md`. Per-harness setup and capability deltas live in [`docs/harnesses.md`](docs/harnesses.md). This file should never grow beyond ~150 lines (per OpenAI's [harness-engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) practice).

## Working in this repo

- Python tooling: **uv** (package manager), **ruff** (lint/format), **ty** (type check). Do not use pip / mypy / black.
- Plugins live under `plugins/<name>/` with auto-discovery — see `docs/authoring.md` for frontmatter shapes.
- Plugin names: lowercase, hyphen-separated. Never use `__` (it's the adapter namespace separator).
- Never commit secrets. Never run destructive git (force-push, `reset --hard`, branch -D) without explicit ask.

## Quality gates (run these before pushing)

```bash
make validate STRICT=1     # structural validation across all harness outputs
make garden                # drift detection (dead links, stale artifacts, oversize skills)
make test                  # full pytest suite (plugin-eval + tools/tests/)
make smoke-test            # real-CLI subprocess tests against generated artifacts
```

CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs all four on every PR plus installs OpenCode + Antigravity CLI + Pi for live verification.

## Regenerating per-harness artifacts

```bash
make generate HARNESS=codex        # .codex/skills, .codex/agents, .codex/plugins/<p>/, .agents/plugins/marketplace.json
make generate HARNESS=cursor       # .cursor-plugin/{marketplace,plugin}.json, .cursor/rules/
make generate HARNESS=opencode     # .opencode/{skills,agents,commands,plugins}/, opencode.json
make generate HARNESS=antigravity  # .antigravity/plugins/<p>/
make generate HARNESS=copilot      # .copilot/{skills,agents,commands}/
make generate HARNESS=pi           # .pi/{skills,prompts,agents}/
make generate-all                  # every harness
```

Small native-install registries are committed for tools that support that route. See the installation commands in [docs/harnesses.md](docs/harnesses.md). The transformed skill and agent trees under `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.copilot/`, `.antigravity/` and `.pi/` stay gitignored and are rebuilt locally. Under `.pi/` the generator owns only `skills/`, `prompts/` and `agents/`, because Pi reads its own project config from the same directory. Run `make generate-all` before committing source changes. It also prunes artifacts whose source was removed, and CI fails on drift. Source files live only under `plugins/`. Never hand-edit generated files.

## Skills (cross-harness)

184 skills under `plugins/*/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` — discoverable by every harness:

- **Claude Code**: auto-discovery via Anthropic's SKILL.md spec
- **Codex CLI**: mirrored to `.codex/skills/<plugin>__<skill>/` (8 KB body cap; detail in `references/details.md`)
- **OpenCode**: mirrored to `.opencode/skills/<plugin>-<skill>/` using hyphenated names for global install
- **Cursor**: reads `.claude/skills/` directly (no re-emit)
- **Antigravity CLI**: native plugins at `.antigravity/plugins/<p>/` — bare `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (no `<plugin>__` namespacing; the plugin dir already scopes it)
- **GitHub Copilot**: mirrored to `.copilot/skills/<plugin>__<skill>/`. Commands also become user-invocable skills.
- **Pi**: mirrored to `.pi/skills/<plugin>/<skill>/`; discovery is recursive so names stay bare
- **Skills-only installers**: `gh skill install wshobson/agents` and `npx skills add wshobson/agents` read `plugins/*/skills/` from GitHub directly (see `docs/harnesses.md`); `make smoke-test` runs both plus the agentskills.io spec check

## Subagents (cross-harness)

202 subagents under `plugins/*/agents/<name>.md`. Per-harness transpilation:

- **Codex**: `.codex/agents/<plugin>__<agent>.toml` (drop `tools:`, map model alias to the GPT-5.x family, infer `sandbox_mode`)
- **OpenCode**: `.opencode/agents/<plugin>__<agent>.md` with `mode: subagent` + `permission:` block (locked agents — those with source `tools: []` — get deny-everything except base `skill`/`task`)
- **Antigravity CLI**: `.antigravity/plugins/<p>/agents/<agent>.md` (Markdown + YAML frontmatter, `model:` is a tier alias — `inherit`/`flash`/`pro`); TOML commands at `commands/<p>/<cmd>.toml` (agy reports these as "converted to skills"); global install via `make install-antigravity` symlinks each plugin into `~/.gemini/config/plugins/`
- **GitHub Copilot**: `.copilot/agents/<plugin>__<agent>.agent.md` profiles with translated tool names and Claude model IDs.
- **Pi**: `.pi/agents/<plugin>__<agent>.md` in the reference `subagent` extension's format (name, description, tools, model); commands become prompt templates at `.pi/prompts/<plugin>__<cmd>.md`
- **Cursor**: reads `.claude/agents/` directly

## Why this file is short

Per OpenAI's harness-engineering practice: this file is a **map**, not an encyclopedia. Procedural detail lives in skills (loaded on demand by agents). Reference material lives in `docs/` (loaded when an agent navigates). A single bloated AGENTS.md crowds out the task, rots quickly, and is hard to verify mechanically. Keep it lean; push detail elsewhere.

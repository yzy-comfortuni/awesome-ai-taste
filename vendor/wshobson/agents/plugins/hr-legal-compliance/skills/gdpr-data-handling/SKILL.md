# GDPR Data Handling

Practical implementation guide for GDPR-compliant data processing, consent management, and privacy controls.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building systems that process EU personal data
- Implementing consent management
- Handling data subject requests (DSRs)
- Conducting GDPR compliance reviews
- Designing privacy-first architectures
- Creating data processing agreements

## Core Concepts

### 1. Personal Data Categories

| Category               | Examples                    | Protection Level   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Basic**              | Name, email, phone          | Standard           |
| **Sensitive (Art. 9)** | Health, religion, ethnicity | Explicit consent   |
| **Criminal (Art. 10)** | Convictions, offenses       | Official authority |
| **Children's**         | Under 16 data               | Parental consent   |

### 2. Legal Bases for Processing

```
Article 6 - Lawful Bases:
├── Consent: Freely given, specific, informed
├── Contract: Necessary for contract performance
├── Legal Obligation: Required by law
├── Vital Interests: Protecting someone's life
├── Public Interest: Official functions
└── Legitimate Interest: Balanced against rights
```

### 3. Data Subject Rights

```
Right to Access (Art. 15)      ─┐
Right to Rectification (Art. 16) │
Right to Erasure (Art. 17)       │ Must respond
Right to Restrict (Art. 18)      │ within 1 month
Right to Portability (Art. 20)   │
Right to Object (Art. 21)       ─┘
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Minimize data collection** - Only collect what's needed
- **Document everything** - Processing activities, legal bases
- **Encrypt PII** - At rest and in transit
- **Implement access controls** - Need-to-know basis
- **Regular audits** - Verify compliance continuously

### Don'ts

- **Don't pre-check consent boxes** - Must be opt-in
- **Don't bundle consent** - Separate purposes separately
- **Don't retain indefinitely** - Define and enforce retention
- **Don't ignore DSARs** - 30-day response required
- **Don't transfer without safeguards** - SCCs or adequacy decisions
